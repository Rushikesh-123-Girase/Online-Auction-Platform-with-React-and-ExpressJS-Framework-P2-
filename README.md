# Online-Auction-Platform-with-React-and-ExpressJS-Framework-P2-
ðŸ“Œ Project Summary
The Online Auction Platform is a dynamic web application built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS). This platform enables users to register, log in securely, list their products for auction, and place real-time bids on listed items. It provides a user-friendly interface with a responsive design for smooth navigation across devices.

The backend is powered by ExpressJS and NodeJS, handling all the server-side logic and API endpoints, while MongoDB stores all auction-related data such as users, products, and bids. ReactJS is used to build the frontend, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience. An admin panel is also included to manage listings and monitor platform activities.

This project bridges the gap between traditional and digital auctions by offering a scalable, efficient, and transparent online bidding environment.
